NEW DELHI: Actual de-escalation along the India-China frontier is still a long way off. 
The operational situation in eastern Ladakh remains on a knife-edge with no concrete breakthrough in the latest round of military talks on Sunday, though both sides have decided to meet again soon to “jointly advance disengagement” among frontline troops. 
In a joint statement issued on Monday, India and China said the marathon ninth round of corps commander-level talks, which began at 11 am on Sunday and lasted till 2.30 am on Monday, was “positive, practical and constructive” in further enhancing mutual trust and understanding between the two militaries. 
The two sides reiterated their intention to “push for an early disengagement of the frontline troops” from the “friction points” at Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas in eastern Ladakh. 
But the exact modalities, sequencing of steps and the joint verification mechanism in the proposed disengagement plan, which was broadly agreed to by the two sides during the eight round of military talks on November 6, have still not been finalized, said sources on Monday. 
India made it clear on Sunday that the proposed disengagement had to simultaneously take place at all the face-off sites, including the north bank of Pangong Tso where the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has occupied and fortified the 8-km stretch between 'Finger 4 to 8’ (mountainous spurs) since early-May. 
China has been insisting that Indian troops should first pullback from the south bank of Pangong Tso-Chushul area, where Indian troops occupied tactically advantageous positions on the ridge line stretching from Thakung to Gurung Hill, Spanggur Gap, Magar Hill, Mukhpari, Rezang La and Reqin La (Rechin mountain pass) on August 28-30. 
This major bone of contention delayed the ninth round of military talks by well over two months. 
“But the tone and tenor of the joint statement on Monday is more positive in bridging the gap towards arriving at a mutually-acceptable solution,” said a senior officer. 
In the joint statement, the two militaries agreed to follow the “important consensus of their state leaders, maintain the good momentum of dialogue and negotiation” and hold the 10th round of corps commander talks at an early date. 
 The two sides will meanwhile “continue” their efforts to ensure their frontline troops exercise restraint, stabilize and control the situation along the Line of Actual Control in the western sector of eastern Ladakh to “jointly maintain peace and tranquility”, it said. 
The previously-unoccupied heights in the Kailash range taken by the Indian Army in end-August have provided India with some leverage to demand “complete disengagement and de-escalation” at all the face-off sites in eastern Ladakh. 
India, of course, remains wary of the way the PLA has consolidated its military positions and upgraded its infrastructure all along the 3,488-km LAC, stretching from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. 
Army chief General M M Naravane on January 12 had said India was fully prepared to hold ground in eastern Ladakh against China for as long as it takes to meet “national objectives”. 
But he had also expressed hope that India and China would “amicably resolve” the ninth-month long military confrontation in eastern Ladakh on the basis of “mutual and equal security” through diplomatic and military talks.
