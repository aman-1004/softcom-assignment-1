NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry has issued an advisory to all states and Union Territories asking them to take immediate steps to ensure compliance with the Transgender Persons (protection of rights) Act 2019. 
In order to prevent any sort of discrimination, the law provides for setting up of a ‘Transgender Protection cell’ under the charge of the district magistrate in each district. 
It also madnates setting up a state level cell under the director general of police to monitor cases of offences against transgender persons and ensure timely registration, investigation and prosecution of such offences. 
The MHA states in the advisory that the law calls for measures for not only providing for welfare but steps for rescue, protection and rehabilitation of a transgender person. 
On the punitive provisions of the law, the MHA advisory states that as per the provision of the TG Act it is a punishable offence in case anyone compels or entices a transgender person to indulge in forced bonded labour, obstructs their right to a public place and forces them to leave their house, village or any place of residence. 
It is further stated that if anyone tries to cause harm or injuries or endangers the life, safety, health or well-being of a transgender person or causes sexual, physical, verbal and emotional abuse, the offence is punishable under the TG Act. 
The TG law also mandates that the states and UTs must ensure that public transport must have harassment free zones for transgender persons and measures for their safety during travel. 
The MHA has also enclosed with the advisory a letter from October last year from the ministry of social justice and empowerment where they inform about the provisions of the new law and measures for compliance.
